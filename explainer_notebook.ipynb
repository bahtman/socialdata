    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen a dataset with country wide traffic accidents in the US. This dataset has a lot of data that we can explore, while using the multitude of the tools we have taught in the course. It also opens up the possibility to do advanced analysis. Our goal is to show the user how dangerous it can be to drive during bad/extreme weather conditions, using interactive tools. We believe that by doing this, the user is more entertained and invested in the findings of our analysis.\n",

    "# Basic stats\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the analysis, we have had to remove some of the non-important features of our dataset. We did this by removing 26 attributes. Furthermore some cleanup was needed to remove n/a values. \n",
