    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen a dataset with country wide traffic accidents in the US. This dataset has a lot of data that we can explore, while using the multitude of the tools we have taught in the course. It also opens up the possibility to do advanced analysis. Our goal is to show the user how dangerous it can be to drive during bad/extreme weather conditions, using interactive tools. We believe that by doing this, the user is more entertained and invested in the findings of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic stats\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the analysis, we have had to remove some of the non-important features of our dataset. We did this by removing 26 attributes. Furthermore some cleanup was needed to remove n/a values. After cleanup, our dataset is 350MB large and contains 20 attributes. As the data is from an american source, we change all units from empirial to metric units.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how weather conditions affect car accidents we will have a main focus on the severity of the car accidents, which is a attribute ranging from 1-4 (4 being the most catastrophic). Our main focus will therefore be on how weather increases or decreases the severity of accidents. \n"
